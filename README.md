#### CodeChallenge: Eventbrite Mini

Please spend no more than **1 hour** to complete the following challenge.

We need three classes in either **Ruby or Javascript**: 
* **Event** - An event has a name, date, and attendees.
* **Person** - A person has a first name and a last name.
* **Invite** -  An invite has a person and an event.

Once completed you should easily be able to create events, and get them attended by many people by way of invites.  The way you structure your api, and how to interact with it is totally up to you.

**Fork this repository** for you solution, and send us the link.
